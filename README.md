# About this Fork

This [fork](https://github.com/sparkworx/buildpack-deps) of [buildpack-deps](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps) adds support for RPM-based Linux distributions, namely [Oracle Linux](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux/) and [Centos](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/centos/). However, it's worth pointing out that due to the dependencies required by buildpack-deps, only version 7 of each can be practically supported. YMMVâ€¦
